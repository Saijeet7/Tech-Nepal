                    Humanity has gone through countless revolutions throughout history. The most recent is the information and communication technology revolution. This revolution generated a schism between the old and the new; what is considered new today becomes an old and obsolete trend the next day. The need for this technology has increased as a result of these changes. As a result, when compared to traditional resources, the latter has become the most widely used, leading to an increase in interest in new information and communication technologies by both businesses and individuals. The world is currently witnessing a rapid evolution in the demand for information facilities in terms of quantity, quality, and access to information, in order to make the best decision possible based on the various changes and dynamics of the organizational environment. This highlights the growing importance of information systems and their ability to meet the information needs of businesses.

                    Impacts of information technologies

                    <h3>The political impact of (IT)</h3>
                    Technology is a source of power. In the political landscape of countries, information technologies play a critical role. They've become popular in electoral campaigns as a way to sway public opinion and, in particular, to engage young people in politics. Politicians employ technology in a variety of ways to impact the development of individuals in their various fields. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are potent communication channels that can instantly boost a politician's popularity. In most political campaigns, technology is a deciding element. Politicians can use technology to obtain access to cash, gain political support, and spend less time campaigning and promoting their candidacy.

                    <h3>The economic impact of (IT)</h3>
                    Increased production, capital accumulation, and intense competition among firms have all been aided by technological advancement and organizational maturity. As a result of this competition, the R&D concept emerged as a strategy of innovation based on the harmony of scientific ideas and their practical application by engineers and scientists. This division of the R&D role into large sections with technical, legal, and administrative skills in maintaining the industrial location and a reference to quality, productivity, and cost became a reflection of the competition. As a result of these achievements, an industrial culture has developed that is driven by scientific and technological advancements that mature and deepen as a natural result of research and development.

                    <h3>The social impact of (IT)</h3>
                    The societal influence of information technology can be divided into two categories. It can't be completely negative or completely positive at the same time. It's a weapon with two sides. The impact of information technology on society has been compared by sociologists to the transformation of the world from enormous continents separating individuals and families to a very tiny town comprising the entire world's population, a process known as globalization. Prior to the advent of information technology, communication between people took days, if not months, to reach each other. Communication between people in different regions of the world has become a simple and quick procedure thanks to information technology, which can be done in a variety of ways: Instant messaging, phone conversations, and video calls are all options.

                    In today's environment, information technology is a must-have. Technological advancement is affecting every aspect of life. Education played a significant role in development and advancement. Information technology has dramatically altered human life, and not all of the changes are favourable. Some of them may be negative and have a negative impact on the individual as well as the community. Traffickers, for example, use the Internet to advertise and market their wares for sale. Technology can be used for a variety of purposes, including science, education, and the economy. Science and technology have a symbiotic relationship. It should be emphasized that the foundation of technology is the study of science and the application of (IT) inventions in various aspects of life in order to suit the demands of individuals and the societies.
